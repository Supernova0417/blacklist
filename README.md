# What Is the Blacklist?

A script-package to Manage Emails, IPs, IP Ranges, ASNs in the CUSTOM LISTS tab on https://proxycheck.io/dashboard/

# How to set it up?

1. Clone this to your own machine

2. Run blacklist.py, and check if it creates blacklists well

3. Synchronize the list on your machine with the one of proxycheck.io
>There are ways to set up web services such as Nginx and Apache on your machine so that the list can be viewed directly by proxycheck.io, or to upload the list to a third platform using API and connect it to proxycheck.io
